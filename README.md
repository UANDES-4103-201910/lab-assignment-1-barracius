"Elements" tab:  The first tag that can be seen, its the <html op="news">...</html>, where thats the required format
to start a html code. Inside the first tag (...), a <head>...</head> and a <body>...</body> tags can be seen, where
they signal what's inside the head and the body of the page respectively. Looks like everything that is inside the
head tag, isn't shown for the user. The text is done by using CSS, <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="news.css?5rgSLyaCjnnNgCLKQdUi">
can be seen on the head tag. The body tag has a sub tag named center, <center>...</center>. Inside the center tag,
there is a table tag, signalings the table's id, border, cellpading, cellspacing, width and background's color.
<table id="hnmain" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="85%" bgcolor="#f6f6ef">...</table>. Inside, ther
is a table body tag, <tbody>...</tbody>. Which is separated in 3 <tr>...</tr> tags, where each one represents one
section of the page that the user can see, for instance, the first tr tag correspond to the orange rectangle on the top
of the page, the second is for the list with news on the center of the page, and the last one is the footer at the end
of the page. Looks like to create the Hyper links the page uses a <a href="link of the page we wanna link">Name that's
gonna show for the hyper link</a>.

the "Elements" tab.
