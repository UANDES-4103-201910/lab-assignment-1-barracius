"Elements" tab:  The first tag that can be seen, its the html tag, required for commencing an html code.
Inside the html tag, there is a head tag and a body tag, signalling what's inside the head and the body of the page respectively. 
Looks like everything that is inside the head tag, isn't shown for the user. Except for the format of the text, where there is a CSS code on the head tag
The body tag, has a center tag. Inside, there is a table tag, signaling the table's id, border, cellpading, cellspacing, width and background's color. 
Inside the table tag, there is a table body or tbody tag. Which is separated in 3 tr tags, where each one represents one
section of the page that the user can see, for instance, the first tr tag corresponds to the orange rectangle on the top
of the page, the second is for the list with news on the center of the page, and the last one is the footer at the end
of the page. Looks like to create the Hyper links the page uses an "a" and "href" tag.

"Sources" tab:

the "Elements" tab.
